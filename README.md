Pension Contribution Test Design Kata
======================================

There are some bugs in the code (marked with comments). For each bug, write a unit test that fails with a good error message. Then fix the bug and make sure the test now passes. Repeat for other bugs.

When all the marked bugs are fixed, discuss:

* What general advice would you give for designing tests to ensure the failure messages are useful for finding bugs?
* Are there any kinds of bugs your unit tests will not be able to expose?


Sample solution
---------------

The "sample_solution" branch shows one way to solve this exercise. We suggest you try it for yourself before looking at it. There is more information in the README file in that branch.
